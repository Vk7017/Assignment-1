Binary Search Algorithm
This Java program implements the binary search algorithm to find the position of an element in a sorted array. The user is prompted to enter the size of the array, followed by the elements of the array. Finally, the program asks for the element to be searched, and it outputs whether the element is found and its position if present.

Usage
Enter the Size of the Array:

Run the program and input the size of the array when prompted.
Input Elements of the Array:

Enter each element of the array one by one as prompted.
Enter the Element to Be Searched:

After entering the array elements, provide the element you want to search for.
Program Output:

If the element is found, the program will print "Element present at [position] position."
If the element is not found, the program will print "Element not found."
